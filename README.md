# Cash and Calories calculator #

### Description ###
You can easily keep track of expenses and plan a budget, as well as get in shape by counting the calories eaten. The reference currency is the Russian ruble.
In this project I practiced with Python and OOP, as well as the Datetime library.

### Technology
Python 3.7
DateTime 4.1

### Starting project
From command line:
  1. ```git clone https://github.com/MatveiAleksandrovich/Cash-Calories-Calculator.git```
  2. ```CashCaloriesCalc.py```

### Improvement ideas
1. GUI with Tkinter
2. Give user chance to changing reference currency
